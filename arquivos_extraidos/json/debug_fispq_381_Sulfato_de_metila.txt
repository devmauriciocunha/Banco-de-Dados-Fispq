5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES
Suitable extinguishing media
Use water spray, alcohol-resistant foam, dry chemical or carbon dioxide.
Special protective equipment for fire-fighters
Wear self contained breathing apparatus for fire fighting if necessary.
6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES
Personal precautions
Wear respiratory protection. Avoid breathing vapors, mist or gas. Ensure adequate ventilation. Evacuate
personnel to safe areas.
Environmental precautions
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Do not let product enter drains.
Methods for cleaning up
Soak up with inert absorbent material and dispose of as hazardous waste. Keep in suitable, closed containers
for disposal.
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE
Handling
Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use.Avoid inhalation of vapour or mist.
Keep away from sources of ignition - No smoking. Take measures to prevent the build up of electrostatic
charge.
Storage
Store in cool place. Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated place. Containers which are
opened must be carefully resealed and kept upright to prevent leakage.
Moisture sensitive. Handle and store under inert gas.
8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION
Personal protective equipment
Respiratory protection
Where risk assessment shows air-purifying respirators are appropriate use a full-face respirator with multi-
purpose combination (US) or type ABEK (EN 14387) respirator cartridges as a backup to engineering
controls. If the respirator is the sole means of protection, use a full-face supplied air respirator. Use
respirators and components tested and approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH
(US) or CEN (EU).
Hand protection
The selected protective gloves have to satisfy the specifications of EU Directive 89/686/EEC and the
standard EN 374 derived from it. Handle with gloves.
Eye protection
Safety glasses
Skin and body protection
Choose body protection according to the amount and concentration of the dangerous substance at the work
place.
Hygiene measures
Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Wash hands before breaks and immediately after handling the
product.
