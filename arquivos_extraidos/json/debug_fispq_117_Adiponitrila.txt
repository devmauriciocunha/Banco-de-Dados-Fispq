Store in cool place. Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated place. Containers which are
opened must be carefully resealed and kept upright to prevent leakage.
8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION
Personal protective equipment
Respiratory protection
Where risk assessment shows air-purifying respirators are appropriate use a full-face respirator with
multi-purpose combination (US) or type ABEK (EN 14387) respirator cartridges as a backup to
engineering controls. If the respirator is the sole means of protection, use a full-face supplied air
respirator. Use respirators and components tested and approved under appropriate government
standards such as NIOSH (US) or CEN (EU).
Hand protection
The selected protective gloves have to satisfy the specifications of EU Directive 89/686/EEC and the
standard EN 374 derived from it.
Handle with gloves.
Eye protection
Face shield and safety glasses
Skin and body protection
Choose body protection according to the amount and concentration of the dangerous substance at the
work place.
Hygiene measures
Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Wash hands before breaks and immediately after handling the
product.
